    "**Function signature:** `scoreN(N: int, R: int, C: int) -> List[int]`\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Snooker is a cue sport. \n",
    "    It is played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth. \n",
    "    The table has pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a cue stick, players must strike the white ball (\"cue ball\") and use it to get other balls of various colors into the pockets (\"pot the balls\"). Players accumulate points for successfully potting the balls.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Balls that are potted can be divided into two basic groups: the \"reds\" and the \"colors\". At the beginning of a game of snooker (\"a frame\"), there are R identical red balls (\"reds\"), worth 1 points each and C distinct balls of other colors (\"colors\"), worth 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., C+1 points respectively. (Traditional snooker has R = 15 and C = 6, but we are playing a slightly more general version.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The balls must be potted in a correct sequence. The rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    At any moment, one of the two players is at the table. This player can play until they either finish the frame by clearing the table, or until they make a mistake.\n",
    "    With each shot the current player must pot exactly one ball.\n",
    "    If there are still red balls on the table, the ball potted by the first shot must be red. A successfully potted red ball is removed from the game.\n",
    "    After potting a red ball the player must always pot one of the colors. A colored ball successfully potted this way is placed back onto its spot on the table.\n",
    "    The game continues this way (with the player alternately potting a red and a color) until all red balls are gone. After the last red ball the player does still have to pot a color that will get placed back onto the table.\n",
    "    Once the reds are gone, the player must finish the frame by potting the colors in increasing score order. The balls potted during this phase are no longer replaced on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, suppose you just arrived at the table and there are three reds (1 point each), a yellow, a green, a brown, a blue, a pink, and a black ball (2 to 7 points) on the table. The maximum score in this situation is obtained by potting the balls in the order red, black (gets replaced), red, black (replaced), red, black (replaced), yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, black. Your total score for these balls would be 1 + 7 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 51.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You are given the values N, R and C.\n",
    "    At some point during a frame of snooker a player came to the table and potted a valid sequence of balls that scored them exactly N points.\n",
    "    Find and return any one such sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "    There are many other valid ways to score 12 points, including {1, 5, 1, 5}, {1, 3, 1, 7}, and {1, 2, 2, 3, 4}.\n",

    "    The player pots the last red ball.\n",
    "    The player follows this by potting a colored ball (the yellow, worth 2 points). The yellow ball gets replaced.\n",
